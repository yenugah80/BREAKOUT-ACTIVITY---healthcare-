Question 1

Create a Jupyter Notebook or Quarto document that solves a regression problem using a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression).

The dataset you use should be related to healthcare (e.g., predicting weight based on height, age, and exercise level). Downloadable from Kaggle or UCI repository 
Your notebook should include:
Data loading and preprocessing
Model training
Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Reflection on the problem and solution in a README file.
